Hi!

One of the ways I'm learning Python is reading through Al Sweigart's book, Automate the Boring Stuff with Python.

I'll use this repo to build out some of the programs he uses in the book **before** I follow along with his code examples.

He provides the output of his programs before showing how he coded it, so I'll look at that output, and see if I can engineer a program that does the same.  It'll take me longer, but it's better practice for my brain!

Thanks,
J
